//Pseudocode

//Create a function called getComputerChoice that randomly
//picks between rock paper or scissors. Ensure that the random picking
//system works with consolelogs before making any other portions of the game.

let choices = ['rock','paper','scissors']

//function getComputerChoice(computerSelection) {
    let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length);
    console.log(random)
//}








// Create a function that actually plays the round. It will include two
//elements called playerSelection (NOT CASE SENSITIVE) and computerSelection, followed by
//a string that displays the winner and how they won (i.e rock over scissors)
